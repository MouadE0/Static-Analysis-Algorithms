# Static-Analysis-Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of static analysis algorithms for various scenarios accomplished during my academic project at CentraleSup√©lec University in 2023. The provided code is organized into two distinct files, each addressing specific aspects of static analysis.

## BE1: Path Analysis

BE 1 focuses on path analysis within a graph structure. The provided Datalog code defines predicates and rules for answering queries related to paths, reachability, connected components, path lengths, and shortest paths. The questions addressed range from basic graph traversal to more advanced concepts like finding the shortest paths between nodes.


## BE2: Points-to Analysis

File 2 deals with points-to analysis in the context of program memory and addresses questions related to aliasing, pointer assignments, and function calls. The Datalog code models a simplified program with pointer manipulation operations.


# BE3 : Polynomial-Roots-Library

This repository contains a C library for computing roots of second-order polynomials (`ax^2 + bx + c = 0`). The library is designed to handle integer coefficients (`a`, `b`, `c`) and provides solutions in the form of float roots. The library is accompanied by unit tests to ensure its correctness.
